Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for reaching out about your wedding photography! I'm thrilled to hear about your upcoming celebration.

Your inquiry stood out to me, and I'd love to learn more about your vision for your special day. Every wedding is unique, and I want to make sure we're the perfect fit for capturing your story.

I'd love to schedule a quick call this week to discuss your wedding details, timeline, and how I can serve you best. 

Are you available for a 15-20 minute call in the next day or two? If so, please let me know a few times that work for you, and I'll send over a calendar link.

Looking forward to connecting!

Warm regards,
Tyler Reese
