Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out about Rehive! I'm excited to learn more about your business and how we might be able to help.

It sounds like you have some specific needs, and I want to make sure we understand your situation fully before suggesting how Rehive can support you.

Would you be open to a brief call this week? I'd love to hear more about:
- Your current workflow challenges
- What you're hoping to achieve
- Your timeline for making a change

I'm confident we can find a solution that works for you. Let me know a few times that work, and I'll send over a calendar link.

Looking forward to connecting!

Best,
Tyler Reese
