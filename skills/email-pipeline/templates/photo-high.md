Hi [Name],

Thank you for your inquiry about wedding photography! I appreciate you thinking of By The Reeses for your special day.

I'd love to learn more about your wedding and see if we're a great fit. To help me serve you best, could you share a few more details?

- Your wedding date
- Wedding location (city/venue if you know it)
- Approximate guest count
- Any specific photography priorities or vision you have

Once I have those details, I can share more about our packages and availability.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Tyler Reese
