# CAPTION IMPLEMENTATION SOP
## How to Use the Caption Generation Skill

**For:** Ada (primary), Marcus (overseer), Walt (quality review)  
**Foundation:** CAPTION-GENERATION-SKILL.md + THE-REESES-BRAND-VOICE.md  
**Workflow:** Linear (input → output), no loops until quality is locked  
**Quality Gate:** Marcus reviews before Tyler sees  

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- New photo/video content is ready for Instagram caption
- Website copy needs rewriting (from Instagram version)
- Email announcement needed
- Blog post needs social caption variant
- Any platform-specific caption is needed

**Do NOT use this for:**
- Website homepage copy (use website-specific tone)
- Legal/terms content
- Announcements with hard CTAs (non-urgent)

---

## Input Template

When requesting a caption, provide ALL 7 required inputs:

```
IMAGE/VIDEO: [Link or description]
COUPLE: [Real names]
LOCATION: [Specific venue + city, state]
DATE: [When did this happen]
WHAT HAPPENED: [1-2 sentences on key moments/emotion]
STRATEGY GOAL: [Establish Authority / Deepen Connection / Support SEO / Invite Inquiry / Reinforce Positioning]
TARGET PERSONA: [Discerning Couple / Southern Traditional / Luxury Planner]
PLATFORM: [Instagram / Website / Email / Blog / TikTok]

Optional:
KEYWORDS: [Primary + secondary if known; Marcus researches if blank]
FUNNEL STAGE: [Top / Middle / Bottom - if differs from strategy goal]
NOTES: [Any special context]
```

---

## Workflow (20-Step Protected Process)

### Phase 1: Validate (1-2 min)
1. **All 7 inputs provided?** If NO → Ask for clarification
2. **Real couple names (not "Sarah & Mike")?** If generic → Ask for real names
3. **Specific location?** If vague → Ask for venue name + city
4. **Platform specified?** If unclear → Ask

### Phase 2: Strategy (2-3 min)
5. **Check content rotation** - Where in 7-post cycle?
6. **Select framework** - Choose 1 (Storytelling / Bold Statement / Authority / Educational / Emotional / Venue Spotlight / Planner-Focused)
7. **Check funnel stage** - Top / Middle / Bottom (affects CTA approach)

### Phase 3: Research (3-5 min, if needed)
8. **Research keywords** (if not provided) - Use Option B logic or escalate to Ada for Option A

### Phase 4: Deep Dive (5-10 min)
9. **Emotional depth check** - What micro-moment did guests miss? What did the room feel like?
10. **Opening line strategy** - What specific detail / statement / real moment opens this?
11. **Check no-echo** - Do recent captions have similar openings? Restructure if needed
12. **Brand voice alignment** - Documentary + refined? Intentional? Timeless?

### Phase 5: Draft (10-15 min)
13. **Draft caption** using template structure (Hook → Body → Reflection → CTA)
14. **Apply brand voice filters** - No clichés, no urgency, no sentimental drift
15. **Check repetition guardrail** - Rotate core phrases (in-between → quiet moments, intentional → considered)
16. **Escalate micro-moments** - Include at least one observation guests would miss

### Phase 6: Refine (5-10 min)
17. **Complete editing pass** - Remove redundancy, urgency, clichés, tighten rhythm
18. **Apply restraint filter** - Remove 1 adjective, 1 intensifier, exclamation, decorative flourish
19. **Apply SEO support** - Venue name once, city/state once, keyword naturally placed
20. **Determine CTA** - Select from approved library only (no improvisation)

### Phase 7: Final Quality (2-3 min)
21. **Quality score** - 4+ on all: Brand alignment / Emotional specificity / Clarity / Strategic intent / Restraint
22. **Substance check** - Would this apply to any wedding? If yes → Rewrite
23. **Final read** - Does it sound like The Reeses?

```

## Quality Gates

Before Marcus sees it:

✅ All 23 quality checks passed?  
✅ Quality score 4+ on all 5 dimensions?  
✅ No clichés detected?  
✅ No echo (opening is fresh)?  
✅ Micro-moment included?  
✅ Restraint filter applied?  
✅ Substance test passed (not generic)?  
✅ Brand voice feels authentic?  

If NO on any: Revise before Marcus review.

## Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue: Opening feels generic**
→ Add specific detail. Replace "If you've been dreaming..." with couple name + specific action.

**Issue: Caption too long**
→ Cut ruthlessly. Remove adjectives. Combine sentences. Check word count by objective (Authority 120-220, etc.)

**Issue: Tone feels sentimental**
→ Emotional, not sentimental. Remove "magical," "dream," "fairy tale." Use specific moments instead.

**Issue: Persona unclear**
→ Identify who this speaks to most (70%). Make that persona's language explicit. Remove language for other personas.

**Issue: Micro-moment missing**
→ Add one observation most guests wouldn't notice. What did you see that they didn't?

**Issue: CTA sounds pushy**
→ Use approved library only. "Link in bio" is weaker than "Book now." Luxury never rushes.

## Platform Calibration (Adapt, Don't Copy)

**Instagram → Website:**
- Remove 50-60% of words
- Tighten narrative expansion
- Add authority language
- Remove exclamation points
- Make CTA more direct

**Instagram → Email:**
- Make more personal ("We" → "I")
- Add warmth
- Shorten paragraphs
- Change CTA to one-to-one invitation

**Instagram → Blog:**
- Expand for keyword depth (if relevant)
- Add context/education
- Include internal links
- Format for scanning (H2s, bullets)

**Instagram → TikTok:**
- Cut 70% of words
- Make it punchier
- Add personality/behind-scenes
- Use "we" language

**Never reuse caption verbatim.** Each platform = new version.

---

## When to Escalate

Ask Marcus to review if:
- Input is ambiguous or incomplete
- Persona targeting conflicts with strategy goal
- Keywords need Option A research (Ubersuggest validation)
- Caption feels close but something's off (get second opinion)
- Platform calibration is unclear
- Quality gates feel subjective

Marcus will decide: Revise, approve, or escalate to Tyler.

## Ada's First Task

**Goal:** Validate the skill with real work before MC integration.

**What Ada will receive:**
- This SOP
- CAPTION-GENERATION-SKILL.md (full)
- THE-REESES-BRAND-VOICE.md (reference)
- First real photo + all 7 inputs

**What Ada produces:**
- 1 complete caption (20-step workflow applied)
- Output formatted correctly
- Quality gates passed

**Marcus reviews:** Checks for brand alignment, persona targeting, emotional specificity, restraint, uniqueness.

**If approved:** This becomes the template. Ada continues generating captions per requests. Every 5 captions, Marcus spot-checks. Every 30 days, full audit for drift.
