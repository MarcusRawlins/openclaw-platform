Before publishing anything, ask:

**"Would Tyler say this sentence out loud while showing someone the work?"**

If yes → Ship it  
If hesitating → Too polished, rewrite

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Read BRAND-VOICE.md first** — this is the foundation everything else builds on
2. **Review each skill in order:**
   - Email (shortest, most direct)
   - Caption (medium length, story-focused)
   - Blog (longest, polished narrative)
   - Web Copy (structure-focused, benefits-first)
3. **Use the skills immediately** — Ada, Ed, and other agents can reference them now
4. **Update as needed** — if Tyler's voice shifts, update BRAND-VOICE.md once and all skills inherit the change

---

## 💡 Key Insight

The problem we fixed: Ada was producing "too polished" output because the examples were aspirational/literary, not grounded in how Tyler actually talks.

The solution: We rebuilt everything on real Tyler voice (email patterns, conversational speech) instead of published blog posts.

Result: All skills now produce work that sounds like Tyler talking, not Tyler's marketing team writing.
