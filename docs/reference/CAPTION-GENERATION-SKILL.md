# CAPTION GENERATION SKILL
## Framework for Strategic, On-Brand Captions

**For:** Marcus Rawlins (main agent, Sonnet)  
**Purpose:** Generate strategic Instagram captions, email subject lines, and short-form copy aligned with The Reeses Brand Voice  
**Foundation:** THE-REESES-BRAND-VOICE.md (locked 2026-02-23)  
**Model:** Claude Sonnet (reasoning-heavy work)  
**Output:** Ready-to-post captions with strategic rationale

---

## Caption Priority Order

When generating captions, prioritize in this order:

1. **Brand voice protection** (immutable)
2. **Emotional specificity** (lived-in, not decorative)
3. **Persona alignment** (speak to one primary)
4. **Strategic objective** (authority, inquiry, connection, etc.)
5. **SEO reinforcement** (support, not compete)
6. **Engagement mechanics** (CTAs, hashtags, etc.)

**Rule:** If a caption conflicts with brand voice, brand voice wins. Always.

---

## Primary Goal of Every Caption

Each caption must accomplish at least one of the following:

- Establish authority (show expertise, refined perspective)
- Deepen emotional connection (create recognition, resonance)
- Reinforce documentary positioning (show how you work, what you capture)
- Support SEO architecture (naturally mention venue, location, positioning language)
- Invite quiet inquiry (refined call to action, no urgency)

**If a caption does none of these, it should not be published.**

This protects against filler content and ensures every post serves the brand strategy.

---

## Required Inputs

Before writing, you must have:

- **Venue** (specific location name)
- **City + State** (geography)
- **Type of event** (engagement session, wedding, proposal, etc.)
- **Primary emotion** (what did the couple feel? joyful, intimate, powerful, etc.)
- **One micro-detail** (what moment would most people overlook?)
- **Target persona** (Discerning Couple / Southern Traditional / Luxury Planner)
- **Strategic goal** (authority / inquiry / connection / positioning)

**If these are not provided, ask for them.** Do not generate without structured input.

---

## Input Requirements

When requesting a caption, provide:

### Essential Information
1. **Content Type** (image/video/carousel)
2. **Real Details** (couple names, location, date, what actually happened)
3. **Strategy Intent** (Sell / Educate / Engage / Establish Authority)
4. **Target Persona** (Discerning Couple / Southern Traditional / Luxury Planner / Multiple)
5. **Platform** (Instagram / Email / Website / Outreach)

### Optional Information
6. **SEO Keywords** (if known; Marcus researches if not provided)
7. **Call-to-Action** (inquiry / link in bio / save / share / comment)
8. **Tone Adjustments** (formal / warm / playful—within brand bounds)

### Minimal Input Example
```
Content: Single image
Couple: Sarah & Michael at Bethesda Terrace
Location: Central Park, NYC
Date: October 2025
What happened: Golden hour portraits, intimate moments, couple laughing by the bridge
Strategy: Sell (invitation to inquiry)
Persona: Discerning Couple (primary), Luxury Planner (secondary)
Platform: Instagram
Keywords: Open (Marcus researches)
CTA: Link in bio
```

---

## Strategic Decision Tree

**Step 1: Validate Input**
- All 7 required inputs provided? ✓
- Real couple names? ✓
- Specific location? ✓
- Actual moments described (not generic)? ✓
- Strategy & persona clear? ✓
- Platform specified? ✓

If NO on any: Ask for clarification before proceeding.

---

**Step 2: Select Caption Framework**

Before writing, choose one framework (do not mix unless instructed):

- **Storytelling** - Hook → Real Details → Reflection → Inquiry Invitation
- **Bold Statement** - Provocative opening → Justification → Engagement invitation
- **Problem/Solution** - Challenge → Your Approach → Result → Inquiry
- **Educational Authority** - Question/Insight → Exploration → Answer → Gentle CTA
- **Emotional Reflection** - Emotional Recognition → Specific Example → Invitation
- **Venue Spotlight** - Location's role in the story → Why it matters → Inquiry
- **Planner-Focused** - Logistics/timeline perspective → Your approach → CTA

**This prevents repetitive cadence across captions.**

---

**Step 3: Research Keywords (if not provided)**

Use Option B (educated guessing based on patterns):
- Location + wedding type (engagement photos at [location])
- City + state + service (wedding photographer in [city])
- Venue name + wedding (venue name + wedding photography)
- Emotional intent (engagement photos that feel [descriptor])

**Validation:** Check against Brand Voice SEO guidelines:
- Does it avoid repetition?
- Does it feel natural (not forced)?
- Is it <50 difficulty or <30 minimum?

---

**Step 4: Emotional Depth Check (Before Writing)**

Ask yourself:

- What was one micro-moment most people would have missed?
- What did the room/location feel like?
- What changed emotionally during this scene?
- Is there one sensory detail that makes this real?

**These answers inform the caption. They prevent generic "beautiful wedding" writing.**

---

**Step 5: Draft Caption Structure**

**All captions follow this template:**

```
[HOOK - 1-2 sentences]
Emotional entry point, specific detail, or compelling statement.
Establishes tone and captures attention.

[BODY - 2-4 paragraphs]
Real details from the session.
Couple names, specific moments, location color.
Address target persona(s) naturally.
Weave keywords naturally (not forced).

[REFLECTION/CONTEXT - 1-2 sentences]
Why this moment matters.
What made it special or significant.
Connect to audience emotion.

[CTA - 1-2 sentences]
Inquiry invitation (Link in bio / Ready to chat? / etc.)
Never: "Book now" or urgency language.

[HASHTAGS - 5-10]
Research-backed, relevant, strategic rotation.
Include location + service + style tags.
```

---

**Step 6: Apply Brand Voice Filters**

Before finalizing, check:

**Differentiation Test:**
- Does it feel honest (documentary)? ✓
- Does it feel refined (editorial)? ✓
- Is it timeless (will feel relevant in 20 years)? ✓

**Emotional Intelligence Test:**
- Emotional, never sentimental? ✓
- Specific, not generic? ✓
- Warm, never try-hard? ✓

**Cadence & Restraint Test:**
- Short paragraphs? ✓
- No em dashes? ✓
- No stacked adjectives? ✓
- Clarity over poetry? ✓

**SEO Voice Test:**
- Keywords feel natural? ✓
- Not repeated excessively? ✓
- Reads for humans first? ✓

**Emoji Test:**
- Default: None ✓
- If used: Maximum 1 per caption, only if enhances ✓

---

**Step 7: Editing Pass**

After writing, do this:

- Remove one unnecessary adjective
- Remove one redundant sentence
- Remove any urgency-based language
- Replace any cliché
- Re-read for rhythm

**Luxury brands are edited brands. This pass is critical.**

If the caption can be said in 120 words, do not stretch it to 250.

---

## Restraint Filter

Before publishing, run this final filter:

**Restraint Check:**

Remove:
- One adjective (which one is least essential?)
- One intensifier ("really," "absolutely," "incredibly," etc.)
- Any unnecessary exclamation point
- Any decorative flourish (metaphors that don't land, fancy phrases that add nothing)

**Then re-read.** Does it feel tighter? Better.

**This single pass is where good captions become refined captions.** Luxury tone is edited tone.

---

**Step 8: SEO Support Rule**

When relevant, captions should naturally include:

- Venue name (once)
- City and state (once)
- "Wedding weekend" or positioning language (naturally)
- Never repeat full keyword phrases more than once

**Captions support search authority. They do not replace or compete with site SEO.**

Avoid:
- Hashtag stuffing
- Keyword repetition
- Attempting to rank from Instagram

---

**Step 9: CTA Logic**

Different strategic goals require different invitation types:

- **If goal = Authority** → No CTA (the authority speaks)
- **If goal = Connection** → Soft invitation ("Ready to explore?" / "We'd love to hear your story")
- **If goal = Inquiry** → Refined call to action ("Link in bio" / "We're here to chat")

**Rule:** Never push. Always invite. Never use urgency-based language.

---

**Step 10: Length by Objective**

Choose target length based on caption goal:

- **Authority post** → 120-220 words (show expertise without rambling)
- **Storytelling** → 180-300 words (room for narrative arc)
- **Educational** → 150-250 words (teach without lecturing)
- **Bold statement** → Under 150 words (let conviction stand)

**Platform limits:**
- **Instagram Captions:** Up to 2,195 max (but target by goal above)
- **Email Subject Lines:** 5-8 words
- **Email Body:** 150-400 words
- **Website Short Copy:** 50-150 words
- **Outreach:** 100-250 words

**Rule:** Luxury brands don't ramble. If you can say it in 120 words, do not stretch it to 250.

---

## Examples (By Strategy)

### Example 1: SELL/STORYTELLING
**Input:** Couple names (Alex & Emma), Location (Bethesda Terrace), Moment (golden hour, laughing by bridge), Persona (Discerning Couple), Platform (Instagram)

**Output:**

```
---
CAPTION
---

When Alex and Emma told us they wanted their engagement to feel like a stolen moment in time, we knew exactly where to take them.

Bethesda Terrace, that quiet hour before sunset. The Bow Bridge in soft focus behind them. The light doing what it does best—making everything feel unmistakably themselves.

We didn't direct much. They laughed, we captured. They walked, we followed. They found each other in the crowd, and we were there to document it.

This is what we love about this location: it gives you something rare. Intimacy in a place thousands of people visit daily. A moment that feels completely, unmistakably yours.

---
RATIONALE
---

• Specific moment: Real details (bow bridge, soft focus, laughing) ground it
• Persona: Discerning Couple (documentary approach, intimacy, authenticity)
• SEO: "Bethesda Terrace engagement" in opening, "golden hour" implied through imagery
• CTA: Inquiry-forward without urgency
• Brand voice: Honest + enduring, documentary + refined
```

---

### Example 2: EDUCATE/CURIOSITY
**Input:** Topic (best time for engagement photos), Location (seasonal), Persona (Planner), Platform (Instagram)

**Output:**

```
---
CAPTION
---

What makes late afternoon the best time for engagement photos?

Three things:
The light hits at an angle that's flattering and specific. The streets and parks are quieter. You've had time to breathe and feel like yourselves instead of "the couple being photographed."

If you're planning an engagement session, we recommend 1.5 to 2 hours before sunset. Start where you feel most at home (your neighborhood, a meaningful spot), then move to the main location you've chosen. By the time you arrive, you're loose. Present. Ready.

The best photos happen when the couple feels most like themselves. Timing matters more than lighting.

---
RATIONALE
---

• Educates without preaching
• Practical insight (timing advice) positions authority
• Persona: Planner (gives actionable guidance)
• Engages before asking
• Brand voice: Helpful, specific, honest
```

---

### Example 3: ENGAGE/BOLD STATEMENT
**Input:** Real couple (Galit & Ari), Venue (Brooklyn engagement party), Moment (authentic joy), Platform (Instagram)

**Output:**

```
---
CAPTION
---

Engagement parties aren't just another event. They're a celebration in their own right.

When Galit and Ari asked us to photograph theirs, we said yes immediately. Fifty people, waterfront light, a couple whose warmth made every frame feel genuine.

We didn't pose them. We watched. They laughed, they held hands, they toasted. We documented all of it.

This is what we believe: the moments that matter most are rarely staged. They unfold when you're fully present with each other.

Ready for your own? Link in bio.

---
RATIONALE
---

• Bold statement opens: Creates recognition, invites agreement
• Specific couple + details ground it in reality
• Documentary positioning (we watched, didn't pose)
• Emotional resonance (most valuable moments are real)
• CTA: Engagement focus, not urgency
• Brand voice: Confident, intimate, refined
```

---

---

## Caption Quality Score (Internal)

Rate the caption from 1-5 on:

- **Brand alignment** (Does it sound like The Reeses?)
- **Emotional specificity** (Does it include a micro-moment most would miss?)
- **Clarity** (Is every sentence necessary?)
- **Strategic intent** (Does it accomplish one of the 5 goals?)
- **Restraint** (Is it edited, not over-explained?)

**If any score is below 4, revise before delivery.**

---

## Quality Gates

Before Marcus sends caption to Tyler:

✅ All 7 required inputs provided?  
✅ Framework selected (not mixed)?  
✅ Real couple names + specific details? (No generics)  
✅ Reads for humans first, search engines second?  
✅ Includes one micro-moment most people would miss?  
✅ Includes one sensory detail?  
✅ Avoids all clichés + superlatives?  
✅ No urgency or scarcity language?  
✅ Emotional, never sentimental?  
✅ Brand voice filters pass?  
✅ Editing pass complete (adjectives, redundancy, urgency removed)?  
✅ SEO feels natural (not forced)?  
✅ CTA aligns with strategy?  
✅ Word count within platform limits?  
✅ Emoji: None or maximum 1 if enhances?  
✅ Quality score 4+ on all dimensions?  

If NO on any: Revise before sending.

---

## A Caption Should Never

Hard stops. If detected, rewrite:

- Sound trendy
- Overuse exclamation points
- Use cliché wedding phrases ("dream wedding," "fairytale," "magical day," etc.)
- Start with "If you've been dreaming of…"
- Be longer than necessary
- Use urgency-based sales language ("Book now," "Spots filling," "Limited time")
- Keyword-stuff
- Sound like a marketing coach
- Over-explain
- Use "obsessed," "stunning," "perfect," or superlatives
- Sound sentimental instead of emotional
- Apply to any wedding (must be specific to this couple/moment)

**Substance Check:**
If the caption could apply to any wedding, rewrite it. This rule prevents drift into aesthetic captions that say nothing.

---

## Repetition Guardrail

Avoid repeating core brand phrases in consecutive captions. Rotate language while preserving meaning.

**Core phrases to rotate:**
- "In-between" → "the quiet moments," "the pause," "what unfolded naturally"
- "Intentional" → "considered," "thoughtful," "deliberate"
- "Documentary" → "presence," "witnessing," "capturing what's real"
- "Presence" → "fully there," "undivided attention," "here and now"

**This prevents brand fatigue.** Your voice should feel consistent, not repetitive.

---

## No Echo Rule

Do not reuse opening lines, sentence structures, or metaphors from recent captions within the same session.

**If similarity is detected:** Restructure the opening completely.

**Why:** Luxury brands must feel fresh. Repetition kills perception of originality.

**Examples of echo to avoid:**
- ❌ Last caption: "When Sarah and Michael asked us to photograph..."
- ❌ This caption: "When Alex and Emma asked us to photograph..." (same structure)
- ✅ Better: "Alex and Emma knew exactly what they wanted: presence over performance."

Check recent captions before finalizing. If opening parallels another, rewrite.

---

## Opening Line Discipline

The first line is critical. It either captures or loses attention.

**Opening Line Rule:**

The first line must:
- Contain a specific detail, OR
- Make a clear statement, OR
- Introduce a real moment

**Never open with:**
- "If you've been dreaming of…"
- "There's something special about…"
- "Another beautiful wedding…"
- "We love when…"

**Strong openers:**
- "Alex and Emma chose Bethesda Terrace for one reason: the light hits like gold at 6 PM."
- "The best engagement photos feel like stolen moments."
- "Galit and Ari's Brooklyn party was chaos in the most joyful way."

---

## Emoji Rule

Default: none.

If used:
- Maximum one per paragraph
- Only if it adds clarity or tone
- Never decorative

Never use emoji in:
- Website copy
- Email
- Outreach

---

## Persona Targeting

Every caption should primarily speak to one of the following:

- **Discerning Couple** (editorial + intentionality)
- **Southern Traditional** (family + legacy + elegance)
- **Luxury Planner** (reliability + precision + execution)

**Persona Weighting:**
- 70% of the caption should speak to the primary persona
- 30% may support secondary personas
- Never attempt to fully satisfy all three in one caption

**Do not attempt to speak to all three equally.** This will dilute your voice and weaken the message.

Choose one primary persona per caption.

---

## Key Constraints

**Immutable:**
- Documentary + refined positioning
- No trend-chasing language
- Emotional intelligence, never sentimentality
- Real people, real moments (never invented details)
- Warm but elevated (never try-hard)
- Timeless (will feel relevant in 20 years)

**Flexible:**
- Persona weighting (by post)
- Framework selection (by strategy)
- Tone adjustments (within brand bounds)
- Length optimization (by platform)
- Keyword research method (B default, A for strategic posts)

---

## Skill Owner: Marcus Rawlins

**Uses this skill when:**
- Tyler requests a caption
- New content is ready for posting
- Strategic captions need rework
- Ada needs a template for similar content

**Does not use this for:**
- Bot-generated captions
- Template mass-production
- Automated social scheduling (each post is considered)

---

---

## SEO Reinforcement Rule

When relevant, captions should naturally reinforce SEO architecture:

- Include venue name once (naturally, not forced)
- Include city/state once
- Avoid repeating exact keyword phrases
- Support positioning language ("documentary," "refined," "intentional," etc.)

**Captions are part of your SEO architecture. They support authority built on your site.**

They do not:
- Compete with primary keyword pages
- Attempt to rank from Instagram
- Replace your site's SEO strategy
- Use hashtags as a substitute for on-site optimization

**Created:** 2026-02-23 (Updated 2026-02-23 with strategic refinements)  
**Foundation:** THE-REESES-BRAND-VOICE.md (locked)  
**Status:** Ready for implementation

---

## Caption Optimization Mode

In addition to caption generation, a second mode can rewrite existing captions:

**Optimization triggers:**
- Increase restraint (remove adjectives, simplify)
- Increase specificity (add micro-moments, sensory details)
- Reduce clichés (swap overused phrases)
- Improve persona alignment (clarify who this speaks to)
- Tighten structure (cut redundancy, improve flow)

**Use when:**
- A caption is "good" but not "elite"
- Revising work from other creators
- Refreshing older captions
- A caption feels slightly off but you can't identify why

**This mode will be invaluable for quality refinement.**

---

## Platform Context Awareness

The same content adapts differently to each platform. Never reuse a caption verbatim across platforms—calibrate to each.

**Instagram Captions:**
- Warmth level: High
- Structure: Allows narrative expansion
- Tone: Conversational, personal, can breathe
- Length: 150-300 words typical

**Website Copy:**
- Warmth level: Warm but refined
- Structure: Tighter, more restrained
- Tone: Authority + accessibility
- Length: 80-180 words (no rambling)
- Note: Rewrite Instagram captions for web. Don't copy verbatim.

**Blog Posts:**
- Warmth level: Educational warmth
- Structure: SEO-driven, keyword-aware
- Tone: Expert + approachable
- Length: 500-1,500 words (content-focused)

**Email:**
- Warmth level: Very warm
- Structure: One-to-one, intimate
- Tone: Personal, relationship-forward
- Length: 150-400 words

**TikTok (if applicable):**
- Warmth level: High, slightly more casual
- Structure: Visual-first, brevity
- Tone: Behind-the-scenes, personality
- Length: 20-60 words

**Rule:** Different platform = different calibration. Never copy-paste across platforms. Adapt tone, length, and emphasis to platform context.

---

## 30-Day Brand Review Checkpoint

Every 30 days, Marcus reviews the system for drift:

**Review Questions:**
- Are certain phrases being overused? (Check against Repetition Guardrail)
- Has tone become softer or louder than brand standard? (Compare to Brand Voice doc)
- Are captions becoming longer? (Trend toward verbosity?)
- Is persona weighting consistent? (70/30 split holding?)
- Are openings staying fresh? (No Echo Rule working?)
- Is restraint being maintained? (Adjectives creeping back in?)

**If drift detected:**
- Identify the pattern
- Recalibrate the system (adjust rules, remind team, retrain if needed)
- Document the drift and fix
- Communicate to team

**Why:** Brand erosion happens slowly. A 2% drift per week becomes 50% drift in six months. Catching it early prevents slow corruption of the brand.

**Schedule:** Every 30 days, same day each month (e.g., 24th of each month).

---

## Content Rotation Rule (7-Post Strategic Cycle)

To keep your feed layered and prevent repetitive cadence, rotate caption types within every 7-post cycle.

**7-Post Rotation:**
- 2x Storytelling (emotional narrative, couple journey)
- 1x Authority/Educational (show expertise, teach something)
- 1x Venue Spotlight (location as storytelling partner)
- 1x Emotional Reflection (universal couple feeling)
- 1x Planner-Facing (address logistics/timeline perspective)
- 1x Light Conversion (refined inquiry invitation)

**This prevents:**
- Feed feeling repetitive (same structure every post)
- Overproducing one type (all storytelling, all authority)
- Missing opportunities (not enough planner-focused content)

**Track rotation** by framework type to ensure balance.

---

## Implementation Workflow

1. User provides image + 7 required inputs
2. Marcus validates inputs (or asks for clarification)
3. Check content rotation (where in 7-post cycle are we?)
4. Select caption framework (1 of 7, not mixed)
5. Check funnel stage (Top/Middle/Bottom)
6. Conduct emotional depth check
7. Draft caption using template structure
8. Check opening line (specific detail / clear statement / real moment?)
9. Check no-echo (does opening match recent captions?)
10. Apply brand voice filters
11. Check repetition guardrail (rotate language)
12. Escalate micro-moments (describe something guests missed)
13. Complete editing pass
14. Apply restraint filter (remove adj, intensifier, exclamation, flourish)
15. Apply SEO support rule
16. Determine CTA from approved library
17. Score quality (must be 4+ on all dimensions)
18. Substance check (would this apply to any wedding?)
19. Final read-through (does it sound like The Reeses?)
20. Deliver with strategic rationale

**This ensures every caption is strategic, protective, specific, resilient, and on-brand.**
