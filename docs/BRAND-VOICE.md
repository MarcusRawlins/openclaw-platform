---

## Differentiation Statement

**Documentary at heart, refined in execution.**

We blend documentary storytelling with refined composition, preserving wedding weekends as they unfold while creating imagery that feels honest and enduring.

We do not chase trends. We build work that will feel relevant in twenty years.

We write with emotional intelligence, never sentimentality.

---

## THE VOICE PROBLEM: Aspirational vs. Real

**What we were doing (wrong):**
- "The world shrinks to just the two of you"
- "Beacon Hill isn't just a location. It's a feeling"
- Literary metaphors, poetic devices, trying to sound writerly
- Overuse of descriptive adjectives ("sweeping," "dappled," "timeless")
- Flowery language that sounds written, not spoken

**What we actually do (right):**
- "His hand finding yours in the dark. The pause before the kiss."
- "Everyone feels that way at first. That's literally why we do engagement sessions."
- "Light was perfect. They felt natural. We got great shots."
- Specific details, conversational asides, short/medium/short rhythm
- Language you'd use talking to a couple, not language designed to impress

**The difference:** We're a photographer talking to people, not a magazine writing about photography.

**The quality gate:** Would Tyler say this sentence out loud while showing someone the work?  
If no → Too polished. Rewrite.

**Going forward:** All examples in this doc should reflect REAL voice, not aspirational voice. If you wouldn't say it in a conversation with a couple, don't write it in content.

**Why this matters:** Every social media post, website page, and collaborator conversation should reflect this anchor. Without it, tone becomes aesthetic instead of strategic.

---

## Who You Are

**Business:** The Reeses (Alex & Tyler, husband and wife)  
**Offering:** Wedding weekend documentation, engagement sessions, select portraits and editorials  
**Geographic:** East Coast + destinations worldwide  
**Philosophy:** Intentional storytelling with a documentary approach  
**Who you serve:** Couples who cherish the beauty of the in-between  

**How you talk:** Conversational, direct, warm but refined. Specific details matter. Real moments matter. Trends don't matter.

---

## Who We Write To

We write to couples who value emotional depth, intentional design, and the quiet beauty of in-between moments. Our language assumes maturity and discernment.

**Not for:** Couples who want heavy staging, constant direction, or trend-first imagery. This clarity prevents drift into generic bride language.

---

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Specific Over Generic
Not: "Beautiful wedding photos"  
Yes: "The way light hit the ceremony as she walked down the aisle. His hand finding hers in the dark. The pause before the kiss."

**Application:** Every post should include at least one specific, sensory detail. Specificity creates recognition.

---

### 2. Emotional Over Transactional
Not: "We offer engagement photography services in Boston."  
Yes: "Beacon Hill feels refined. Clean lines. Quiet streets. Nothing loud."

**Application:** Lead with feeling/experience. Services come second.

---

### 3. Warm But Elevated
Not: "Hey girls! So excited to share this!"  
Not: "Professional wedding photography services utilizing industry-leading techniques."  
Yes: "We've photographed countless engagement sessions across Boston, and this pairing remains one of our favorites."

**Application:** You're confident and refined. Not stuffy, not casual.

**What "elevated" means:** Refined word choice (heirloom not photo book), clarity, specificity. NOT poetry or literary devices.

**What "warm" means:** Conversational, personal, genuine. The opposite of corporate or detached.

**What "Warm But Elevated" NOT:** Flowery adjectives, forced metaphors, overly composed sentences.

**Sentence rhythm:** Short → long → short
- "Alex and Emma wanted natural." (5 words)
- "So we took them to Bethesda Terrace where the light turns golden at 6 PM." (16 words)
- "This is what happens." (4 words)

---

### 4. Intentional, Not Accidental
Not: "These photos just happened!"  
Yes: "Every choice is considered. Light, framing, timing. Everything served the couple's story."

**Application:** You think about what you do. You have reasons. Show that thinking.

---

### 5. Real People, Real Moments
Not: Generic couple examples or stock imagery language  
Yes: Use real couple names, real details, specific moments from actual shoots

**Application:** Every post references a real session. Names, locations, details matter. Never invent details. If you don't know it, keep it general.

---

### 6. Documentation With Gentle Guidance
Not: "Pose with your hand on her shoulder. Now look at the camera."  
Yes: "We guide gently and document faithfully."

**Application:** You capture what's real while offering just enough direction to help moments unfold naturally.

---

## Sentence Rhythm: The Short-Long-Short Pattern

Tyler's natural rhythm is **short → long → short**. This is his pulse. Follow it in all writing.

**Example:**
- "We showed up early." (short)
- "The groom was fixing his boutonniere in the mirror, laughing at himself because he kept getting it wrong — trying three times, each one worse than the last." (long)
- "That's the photo we got." (short)

This rhythm is conversational. It's how people actually speak. Use it everywhere.

---

## Conversational Markers Tyler Actually Uses

These phrases feel authentically Tyler, not marketing:

- "No-brainer"
- "Chef's kiss" (when something works)
- "Trusted the process"
- "Everything clicked"
- "Real talk:"
- "Here's the thing:"
- "Worth it"
- "We got the shot"
- "Beautiful light"
- "First-look moment"
- "In between" (the moments, not the place)
- "We showed up and..." (beginning of a story)
- "That moment when..."
- "Light was perfect"
- "They felt natural"

**Important:** These phrases should emerge naturally. Never insert them to sound casual. Forced familiarity breaks voice faster than anything else.

---

## Cadence & Structure

Luxury tone is restraint, not flourish. Your strongest writing is disciplined.

**Rules:**
- Short paragraphs
- Intentional line breaks
- Avoid long compound sentences
- Avoid overuse of commas
- Avoid em dashes
- Avoid stacking adjectives
- If unsure, choose clarity over poetry

**Test:** If a sentence sounds like it belongs on a Pinterest quote board, tighten it.

---

## Platform-Specific Voice Levels

Tyler's voice adapts based on context, not changes fundamentally. Think of it as a dimmer, not a switch.

### Email (90% Conversational + 10% Professionalism)
**Warmth level:** Very warm  
**Energy:** Personal, direct, relationship-forward  
**Length:** 100-400 words  
**Voice shift:** One-to-one, intimate  
**Emoji use:** 0-2 max  
**Tense:** Present/Future  
**Key trait:** Direct, benefit-focused

**What this sounds like:**  
"Thanks for reaching out! We'd love to photograph your wedding. Here's what we focus on: authentic moments, real emotions, and beautiful light. We show up early, we stay late, and we don't ask for a single fake smile."

**What to avoid:** Marketing speak, flowery language, unclear asks.

---

### Instagram Captions (70% Conversational + 30% Artistry)
**Warmth level:** High  
**Energy:** Conversational, present/past-tense storytelling  
**Length:** 60-300 words typically, up to 2,195 max  
**Voice shift:** Personal ("we love," "we noticed") + client-focused  
**Emoji use:** 2-5 max, strategic  
**Tense:** Past tense works here (we shot, they laughed, light was perfect)  
**Key trait:** Storytelling, grounded

**What this sounds like:**  
"6pm light at the courthouse. Her dress caught it first. He wasn't ready for how beautiful she looked. That moment right before he turned and saw her. That's what we love capturing."

**What to avoid:** Flowery descriptions without real detail, overly long sentences, marketing speak.

---

### Blog Posts (70% Artistry + 30% Conversational)
**Warmth level:** Warm but refined  
**Energy:** Reflective, educational, specific  
**Length:** 500-1,500 words (target 900-1,100)  
**Voice shift:** "We" + location expertise + emotion  
**Emoji use:** None  
**Tense:** Past tense for storytelling, present for advice  
**Key trait:** Narrative, polished experience

**What this sounds like:**  
"We showed up to a wedding last spring where the bride's dress caught the light at exactly the right moment. Or maybe the wrong moment. We're still not sure. But what we do know is this: the best weddings are the ones where couples stop worrying about looking good and start feeling real."

**What to avoid:** Overly literary descriptions, prescriptive language, generic advice.

---

### Website Copy (50% Conversational + 50% Professional)
**Warmth level:** Professional but warm  
**Energy:** Clear, scannable, benefits-first  
**Length:** Varies by page (headlines short, body sections medium)  
**Voice shift:** Second-person when appropriate ("You'll receive," "Your photos")  
**Emoji use:** 0-1 at most, if any  
**Tense:** Present tense  
**Key trait:** Clear, benefits-first, easy to scan

**What this sounds like:**  
"Your wedding photos should reflect what actually happened, not a version of it. We capture the glances. The laughs. The tears. The stuff you'll actually want to remember."

**What to avoid:** Flowery language, vague benefits, multiple CTAs, marketing-speak.

---

## The Three Personas (How You Speak to Each)

### Discerning Couple (often bride-led decisions)
**Values:** Editorial aesthetic, intentionality, refinement, artistic depth  
**Language cues:** "Editorial," "composed," "refined," "intentional," "thoughtful"  
**Speak to:** The thoughtfulness behind your approach. The artistic choices. The timeless aesthetic.  
**Example:** "Beacon Hill feels refined—think silk, tailored edges, nothing loud."

### Southern Traditional  
**Values:** Family, legacy, timelessness, elegance with roots  
**Language cues:** "Timeless," "classic," "heirloom," "family," "roots"  
**Speak to:** How you honor what matters. Documentation of real moments. Legacy.  
**Example:** "For couples who want their grandmother to frame these photos with pride."

### Luxury Planner  
**Values:** Reliability, stress reduction, precision, execution  
**Language cues:** "Coordination," "timeline," "seamless," "handled," "you can trust"  
**Speak to:** How you remove variables. How you make their job easier. Dependability.  
**Example:** "We handle photography logistics with quiet precision, so you can stay focused on the larger experience."

**Note:** Most posts target 1-2 personas primarily. Some target all three. Weight depends on content.

---

## Voice Within SEO

Luxury SEO must feel invisible. Search optimization should never compromise voice.

**Keyword Architecture Strategy:**
- Each primary page owns one primary keyword (don't compete internally)
- Social captions reinforce primary keywords, not compete
- Venue names rotate naturally through captions (not listed)
- Avoid repeating full keyword phrases more than once per caption

**Guidelines:**
- Mention city and state where relevant, not repetitively
- Prioritize clarity over lyricism
- Write for humans first, search engines second
- Build keyword relevance through natural language, not repetition

**Example:**
❌ Bad: "Boston engagement photos, Boston photographer, Boston wedding photographer, photography in Boston"  
✅ Good: "Beacon Hill's cobblestone streets have hosted some of our favorite sessions. The neighborhood's architecture photographs beautifully in late afternoon light."

---

## Conversion Language Framework

Define how you invite inquiry, reference limited availability, and discuss investment with calm confidence.

**How to invite inquiry:**
- "If you're considering an engagement session in [location], we'd love to explore what's possible."
- "Couples drawn to this approach often reach out through our website."
- "Ready to start the conversation? We'll guide you through what comes next."

**How to reference limited bookings (without urgency):**
- "We photograph a select number of weddings each year."
- "Our calendar fills with couples whose vision aligns with ours."
- "We work with 12-15 couples annually."

**How to discuss investment with calm confidence:**
- "Our investment reflects the time, skill, and presence we bring to every weekend."
- "We're selective about who we work with, and they're selective about who captures their day."
- Discuss value, not price. Discuss partnership, not transaction.

**How to frame exclusivity without scarcity tactics:**
- Lead with what you do, not what you don't have enough of
- "We choose to work with fewer couples so we can be fully present with each one."
- Never use: "Spots are filling fast," "Only a few dates left," "Book now"

**Avoid:** Urgency, scarcity marketing, artificial deadlines. Luxury loses authority when it sounds desperate.

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Generic opener:**
"If you've been dreaming of engagement photos in Boston..."  
✅ Better: Start with the feeling or the specificity

❌ **Marketing speak:**
"Our innovative approach leverages storytelling frameworks to maximize engagement..."  
✅ Better: "We capture what's real instead of directing what's artificial."

❌ **Clichés:**
- "Magazine-worthy"
- "Unforgettable"
- "Create something beautiful"
- "Tell your love story"
- "Once-in-a-lifetime"
- "Say cheese!"
- "Magical"
- Superlatives: "obsessed," "stunning," "perfect," "literally"
- "Sweeping," "dappled," "timeless," "ethereal"

✅ Better: Be specific about what makes it special

❌ **Literary/flowery language:**
- Metaphors and poetic devices
- Overly composed sentences
- Language that feels written, not spoken
- Descriptions that try to sound beautiful instead of being specific

✅ Better: Use real details and conversational rhythm

❌ **Generic couple reference:**
"A beautiful couple in love..."  
✅ Better: Use real names, real details, real moments

❌ **Overly instructional:**
"Step 1: Choose your outfit. Step 2: Arrive 15 minutes early. Step 3..."  
✅ Better: "We'll guide you through this. Here's how it feels."

❌ **Trying too hard:**
"Hey girl!! OMG this is SO amazing!"  
✅ Better: Warm but elevated, never try-hard

❌ **Urgency and scarcity marketing:**
"Spots are filling fast," "Only a few dates left," "Book now"  
✅ Better: "We photograph a select number of weddings each year"

## Use-Case Specific Examples

### Seasonal Post (Spring Tulips)
**Tone:** Celebratory, time-sensitive, location-specific  
**Persona:** All three (Discerning: editorial quality | Southern: family/legacy | Planner: seasonal timing)  
**Example voice:** "Late April in Boston feels different. The city opens up. Tulips everywhere. The light changes. Suddenly engagement sessions here feel essential—like this particular moment won't come again."

### Technical/Educational Post  
**Tone:** Authoritative but warm, clear, helpful  
**Persona:** Planner + Discerning Couple  
**Example voice:** "We recommend late afternoon, 1.5 to 2 hours before sunset. Here's why: the narrow streets create natural shade early, you'll catch golden hour at the park, and you'll finish with soft, flattering light on the columns."

### Venue Partnership Post  
**Tone:** Collaborative, enthusiastic, specific  
**Persona:** Planner + venue + couples  
**Example voice:** "L'Auberge Del Mar isn't just a venue, it's a storytelling partner. The architecture carries the setting beautifully. Your job is just to be present together."

### Proposal Post  
**Tone:** Emotional, momentous, precise  
**Persona:** All three (Discerning: romantic | Southern: meaningful | Planner: execution)  
**Example voice:** "You'll only propose once. Professional proposal photography ensures that you'll never forget what this moment looked like, felt like, and meant."

---

## Emoji Strategy

**Rule:** Default is none.

**Allow only:**
- One emoji per caption max if it genuinely enhances tone or clarity
- Never in website copy, email, or outreach
- Your strongest captions rarely need them

**When to use:**
- If an emoji adds warmth without feeling forced
- If it serves the message, not the aesthetic
- If removing it would lose meaning

**Your strongest aesthetic:** Clean, unadorned, type-forward. Emoji-free is often the right choice.

---

## Things That Don't Change

1. **Your names:** Alex & Tyler (or The Reeses, but always tie back to the people)
2. **Your philosophy:** Documentary. Intentional storytelling. Capturing what's real.
3. **Your who:** Couples. East Coast. Multi-day weekends. Destinations.
4. **Your why:** "To preserve what it felt like." Real moments matter.
5. **Your editorial approach:** Refined, thoughtful, specific.

---

## Things You Can Evolve

1. **Personas weighted differently** by season/campaign
2. **Content frameworks** (Storytelling, Bold Statement, Problem-Solution, etc.)
3. **Examples** (always add new real shoots)
4. **Specific language** (evolve while keeping core principles)

---

## Internal Compass

**Documentary at heart, refined in execution.**

When in doubt, return to this. It answers every question about The Reeses voice.

**The Quality Gate (Always Ask This):**

**"Would Tyler say this sentence out loud while showing someone the work?"**

If yes → Ship it.  
If hesitating → Too polished. Rewrite.
