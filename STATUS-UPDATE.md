## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### Phase 2: Walt Review (IN PROGRESS)

I've submitted all 7 blogs to Walt for quality review:

**Review Request:** `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/agents/reviews/2026-02-25-ada-blog-review-request.md`

**Waiting for:** Walt's grade (PASS or NEEDS_REVISION)

### Phase 3: WordPress Drafts (ON HOLD)

**ONLY proceed if Walt grades PASS**

If approved, I will:
1. Use browser automation to log into bythereeses.com/wp-admin
2. Create 7 blog posts as DRAFTS (no publishing)
3. Set categories, SEO meta descriptions, focus keywords
4. Capture all draft URLs
5. Leave for Tyler to add photos manually

### Phase 4: Report to Tyler (ON HOLD)

After Phase 3 complete, I will report:
- Total blogs reviewed & fixed (7)
- Summary of all fixes
- Walt's review grade (PASS)
- List of all 7 WordPress draft URLs
- Message: "7 blog drafts created in WordPress. Ready for you to add photos."
