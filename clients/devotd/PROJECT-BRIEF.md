# Devotd.com - Project Brief

## Product
Niche social network + marketplace for theater superfans. "Digital Green Room."
- The Feed: Theater-only social (no algorithm noise)
- The Marketplace: Buy/sell/trade tickets + theater merch
- Networking: Connect around shared obsessions (shows, performers, crafts)
- Vision: Primary commerce hub for fandoms, starting with theater

## The Role
Head of Marketing advisor. Zero-to-one growth strategy.
- Objective: First 10,000+ highly active users, validate transactions
- Resources: Early-stage, low-budget, sole executor
- Secret Weapon: 5 Million theater fan list
- Content Voice: Tanner Smith style - high-energy, infectiously joyful, theater-kid enthusiasm
- Reports to: Founder (Tyler's Uncle)

## Founder
- Jeff (Tyler's uncle). Built the product himself.
- Owns an online ticketing and event management company (schools, local theaters).
- The 5M list comes from his ticketing business.

## The 5M List
- Source: Cur8, Jeff's ticketing/event company customer database
- We have permission to send an initial email campaign
- This is a primary go-to-market lever. Cannot burn it.

## Platform Details
- Web only, mobile-friendly (no native app)
- Launch date: July 1, 2026
- Current: 21 alpha users, 730 posts (all alpha/seed content)
- News pipeline already built and running, just needs strategy for how stories surface in-platform
- Moments: manual entry only for past show attendance

## Goals & Timeline
- 100,000 users by end of 2025 (calendar year)
- Budget TBD. Tyler needs to define strategy + costs first.
- Marketing cost examples to explore: playbill advertising, ticket advertising

## Key Constraints
- Can't burn the 5M list or domain reputation
- Traction is the only metric that matters
- Scrappy > expensive
- Growth loops > one-off campaigns
- Budget not yet set; strategy defines the budget, not the other way around

## Ideas Backlog
- Import past show attendance (from ticketing data or other sources) into Moments

## Verticals (Future)
Theater first, then: Sports, Gaming, other passion-led verticals
