One tradition we love from the west coast (really Utah) is the idea of doing multiple bridal sessions or 2nd formals. These typically take place after the wedding if it's with both the bride and groom, but before the wedding if it's just the bride. We absolutely love these and here's why.

Epic locations need time. When you want mountain backdrops like Park City, alpine meadows, aspen groves stretching for miles, you can't rush it. You can't fit it into a 15-minute window on your wedding timeline. These sessions give you the space to chase light across ridgelines, explore trails in your dress, and actually breathe in the scenery instead of racing through it.

Weather becomes your backup, not your enemy. If your wedding day gets rained out or the light isn't cooperating, you've already got these formals in the bank. Or if conditions are perfect, you get a second round of incredible images in a completely different setting. Either way, you win.

There's no timeline pressure. No guests waiting. No ceremony about to start. Just you, your dress, and a location worth the drive. We've photographed formals in desert canyons, along coastlines, and up in the mountains where you need four-wheel drive to reach the trailhead. The couples who do this always say the same thing after: "I'm so glad we took the time for this."

The light is better because you can plan for it. Golden hour on a weekday evening in the mountains. Soft morning light before the sun gets harsh. You're not locked into ceremony timing or reception schedules. You pick the location, we scout the light, and we show up when it's perfect.

And honestly, you just get space to be together without the wedding day adrenaline. Alex wore her dress twice. Once for the wedding, once for mountain formals the day after. She said the second time felt completely different. Calmer. More intentional. That's what these sessions give you.

This tradition makes so much sense to us. If you're planning a destination wedding or getting married somewhere that doesn't have the landscape you're dreaming of, a bridal session or second formal gives you both. The wedding you want and the photos you want. We love shooting them. The images are always some of our favorites from the year.

If you're considering it, we're here for it. Let's talk locations.
