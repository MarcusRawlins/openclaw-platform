## 📝 KEY LESSONS LEARNED & DOCUMENTED

Added 4 new lessons to `/Users/marcusrawlins/.openclaw/agents/ada/lessons.md`:

1. **Generic Blog Guides Need Real Couple Stories To Pass Quality Gate** — Led with real moments changes entire voice from "venue review" to "story about people"

2. **Flowery Language Kills Authenticity Even In Narrative Blog Posts** — Brand voice is "documentary at heart, refined in execution." Real details beat poetic descriptions.

3. **Real Couple Details Work Across All 4 Blog Voice Frameworks** — Storytelling, Educational, Problem/Solution, Advice — doesn't matter. Specificity matters more than framework choice.

4. **You Don't Need Perfect Session Details To Rewrite Well** — Even a styled shoot (Britton Manor proposal) works if you have real venue details, real timing, real process explanation.

## ✨ TRANSFORMATION PATTERN

**Before rewrites:** Location guides explaining why Beacon Hill / Gandhi Park / DUMBO / etc. photograph well. Generic advice. No couple stories.

**After rewrites:** Real couples with real moments, using real locations that matter to THEM. Educational context still present, but grounded in specific sessions, not generic advice.

**What changed the voice:**
- Real names (Alyssa, Kelly, Nicole, Galit) used early and often
- Real moments (89 Charles bar, Pinterest board, rooftop arrival, front stoop)
- Real details (white maxi dress, navy button-down, dog came and went, heads thrown back laughing)
- Real timing (7:30 AM for empty park, Sunday for fewer crowds, late April for tulip season)
- Authentic voice: "Here's what happened" instead of "Here's what works"
