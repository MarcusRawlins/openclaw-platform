## Final Caption

If we haven't met yet, we're The Reeses, and we're so glad you're here.

We are a husband and wife wedding photography team. We get asked a lot what it's like working with your partner, and we can honestly say we love it.

Tyler handles most of the initial conversations and planning. He'll walk you through timelines, coverage, what to expect. Alex handles all of the editing and creative decisions. On wedding days, we're both photographing and completely in sync.

We work as a team on every wedding. That's not just logistics. It's how we see. One of us is wide, the other is close. One of us is documenting the flow, the other is catching expressions. Together, we get the full picture.

Here's the truth: we love what we do. We love the moment right before a first look. The tears during vows. The laughter that comes out of nowhere during portraits. The chaotic beauty of a reception in full swing.

That's why we're here. Not just to photograph weddings, but to be fully present for yours.

## Process Notes
- Started with 3 options from caption-voice skill (sub-agent)
- Tyler chose Option 2, rewrote the opening to be warmer and more personal
- Added context about Alex handling editing/creative decisions
- Marcus (Opus) polished: comma after "On wedding days," "completely in sync," fixed apostrophe, colon instead of ellipsis
- Key lesson: Tyler's instinct to personalize the opening ("we're so glad you're here") made it significantly better than the AI draft
