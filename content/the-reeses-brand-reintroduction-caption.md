# The Reeses Brand Reintroduction - Instagram Caption

## CAPTION BODY

The best moments at your wedding aren't the ones you planned.

They're the ones that happen in between. The way your fiancé's hand finds yours during a quiet second before the ceremony. The laugh that escapes when you're supposed to be serious. The tears your dad tries to hide. The glance you share that says everything without a single word.

We're Tyler and Jessica Reese, and we've spent years learning to see what most people miss. Our approach isn't about staging perfect moments—it's about being present for the real ones. The documentary-style images that become your legacy. The quiet details that hold the biggest feelings. The honest, unfiltered story of two people building something that matters.

This work is for couples who cherish the beauty of the in-between. Who want their wedding documented, not directed. Who understand that the most meaningful photographs aren't always the prettiest—they're the truest. If you value authenticity over perfection, emotional depth over aesthetic trends, and real connection over what looks good on Pinterest, we see you.

We're here to document what's actually real. To create heirloom images that feel like memory, not marketing. To be fully present for every unguarded moment that makes your story yours.

If this resonates, we'd love to hear from you. Link in bio, or DM us to start the conversation.

## POSTING STRATEGY

### Best Time to Post
**Tuesday or Thursday, 6:00-7:00 PM EST**
- High engagement window when couples are planning together after work
- Avoids weekend noise from other vendors
- Allows momentum to build through evening browsing

### Carousel Strategy

**Image Order:**
1. **Lead with emotion** - Your strongest in-between moment (tears, laughter, intimate detail)
2. Brand identity slide with positioning statement
3. Documentary moment showing your approach
4. Detail shot (hands, dress texture, intimate scene)
5. Wide contextual shot or couple portrait that shows trust/connection

**Why this order:**
- Hook with pure emotion (no logo/text) to stop the scroll
- Introduce who you are once they're invested
- Prove your approach with real moments
- Build trust through variety and consistency
- End strong with something shareable

### Caption Format Notes
- **Line breaks:** Use paragraph breaks generously for readability on mobile
- **Length:** This sits at ~230 words—optimal for engagement without losing attention
- **No emoji:** Maintains sophistication while staying warm
- **Hashtags separate:** Keeps caption clean, hashtags in first comment for discoverability

### Post-Launch Actions
1. **Story support:** Share carousel to Stories with "New post ↓" sticker linking to feed
2. **Engagement window:** Be online for first 60-90 minutes to respond to comments/DMs immediately
3. **Save prompt:** In Stories, add "Save this if you're planning a wedding" to boost algorithm signal
4. **Partner tags:** If any venues/planners/couples can be tagged (with permission), do so for wider reach

### Performance Expectations
- **Save rate** should be high (couples bookmark for reference)
- **Profile visits** will spike (positioning is clear and intentional)
- **DM inquiries** from right-fit couples (documentary style self-selects)
- **Share to Stories** by engaged couples and wedding pros who align with authentic approach

## TONE ANALYSIS ✓

**Warm but sophisticated:** ✓ Uses "we," personal story, but maintains elevated language  
**Speaks to all three personas:**
- Discerning Bride: "authenticity over perfection," "aesthetic trends"
- Southern Traditional: "legacy," "heirloom," family values implied
- Luxury Planner: "documentary-style," professional approach, clear expertise

**Addresses emotional needs:**
- Confidence: "we've spent years learning to see"
- Legacy: "heirloom images that feel like memory"
- Trust: "we see you," understanding their values

**Shows expertise without preaching:** ✓ Demonstrates through storytelling, not credentials  
**Authentic, not salesy:** ✓ No "limited spots" or urgency tactics—invitation, not pitch
