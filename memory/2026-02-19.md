# 2026-02-19 - Full Build Day

## Mission Control Dashboard
- Built FROM jwtidwell/mission_control codebase (not from scratch)
- Brunel completed Phases 1-4:
  - Phase 1: Stripped demo data, rebranded "DEVOTD" → "Reese Operations", replaced Jeff/Henry with Tyler/Marcus
  - Phase 2: Photography Pipeline (Kanban, 7 stages) + Financial Overview panels
  - Phase 3: Client CRM panel with contacts, interactions, follow-ups
  - Phase 4: Content/Social + System Health panels
- 8 views total: Operations, Blueprint, Pipeline, Financials, Clients, Content, System, Documents
- Agent headshots: Tyler generated AI portraits for all 4 agents (9 expressions each, 3x3 sprite sheets)
  - Brunel: British-Caribbean, charcoal henley, workshop background
  - Dewey: African-American, late 50s, corduroy blazer, library setting
  - Marcus: Italian-American, black turtleneck, dark background
  - Scout: Scottish-American, tweed sport coat, neutral background
- Headshots stored in mission_control/public/headshots/
- Documents panel: drag-and-drop upload → Dewey auto-processes → indexed in database
- System Health panel wired to live gateway data (agent status, cron, activity feed)
- Runs on port 3100, accessible on LAN at http://192.168.68.147:3100

## Chat/Messaging Issue (UNRESOLVED)
- Multiple failed attempts to fix Mission Control chat
- Root causes identified:
  1. Gateway was bound to loopback only → fixed to "lan" mode
  2. Browser cached stale ws://localhost:18789 URL → fixed with dynamic hostname detection
  3. Ed25519 device identity auth required by gateway → Brunel mistakenly removed it, had to restore
  4. Still not confirmed working as of 6pm
- **LESSON LEARNED**: Stop guessing and shipping. Diagnose first, test end-to-end, THEN fix. Four attempts without proper diagnosis is unacceptable. Tyler called it out directly.

## Docs Architecture Created
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — system map, directory structure, info hierarchy, agent roster, cost model, roadmap
- docs/PRD.md — our build spec (photography pipeline, CRM, financials, content, system health)
- docs/sops/ — 6 SOPs (Agent Creation, Mission Control, Database, Cron Jobs, Git, Security)
- docs/reference/ — Tech Stack, Integrations, ZipGolf Audit
- docs/REFERENCE-PRD.md — Matt's full PRD as inspiration

## Agent Roster (4 agents)
- Marcus Rawlins (main) — Chief of Staff, Opus 4.6
- Brunel Edison (brunel) — Builder, Haiku 4.5 / Devstral
- Scout Pinkerton (scout) — Research, Devstral / Haiku fallback. Never deployed on a task yet.
- Dewey Paul (dewey) — Data Scraper & Organizer, Devstral / Haiku fallback

## Agent Naming Convention
Both first and last names from historical figures in the agent's domain. Nickname = short first name = agent ID.

## Drive Organization (Dewey's work)
- /Volumes/reeseai-memory/ went from 360 GB → 23 GB
- Clean structure: code/, photography/, data/, agents/, docs/, backups/
- 69 GB duplicates deleted, 6.3 GB build artifacts cleaned
- OLD/ directory fully removed after migration confirmed
- reese-catalog.db: 17 tables, ~67,800 records
  - 3,598 contacts, 53,574 emails, 1,584 calendar events (484 weddings)
  - 3,916 documents, 215 PDFs, 2,892 images, 621 videos, 446 audio
  - YouTube history, subscriptions, notes, tasks, chat, maps reviews

## R3 Studios / ZipGolf
- R3 Studios: custom websites + custom SaaS for small service businesses
- ZipGolf (Birdieway): multi-tenant SaaS for golf courses
  - ~85% complete, 25K LOC, 49 Prisma models, zero tests
  - GitHub: ParkerR22/ZipGolf.git
  - Located at /Volumes/reeseai-memory/code/zipgolf/
  - Stack: Next.js 16, Bun, PostgreSQL + Prisma 7, Stripe Connect, Tailwind 4

## Gateway Config Changes
- Bind changed from "loopback" to "lan" (for Mission Control network access)
- Token auth still active

## Key Decisions
- Mission Control to eventually replace OpenClaw's built-in Control UI as primary gateway interface
- External drive (/Volumes/reeseai-memory/) is primary storage for databases, not workspace
- Workspace stays lightweight (code + configs), drive holds heavy data
- Backup drive at /Volumes/BACKUP/reeseai-backup/
- Tyler's co-founder: Parker Reese (GitHub: ParkerR22)

## Process Lesson
Tyler rightfully called out that I'm not a good programmer and keep guessing instead of diagnosing. The pattern: ship untested fixes → fail → guess again → fail again. The fix: diagnose root cause first, test end-to-end before telling Tyler to try, don't have Brunel rewrite code I don't understand.

## Evening Session (10pm+)

### Chat/Messaging FIXED
- Root cause: device pairing required by gateway. Tyler's browser device was pending approval.
- Used `openclaw devices list` to find pending, `openclaw devices approve` to approve.
- Gateway origin allowlist: added http://localhost:3100 and http://192.168.68.147:3100
- Gateway URL auto-detects from browser hostname (no more cached localhost)

### AnselAI Brand
- Tyler's photography CRM/business section name (Ansel Adams reference)
- Mission Control splitting Financials into AnselAI + R3 Studios

### Two New Agents
- **Ed Adler** (id: ed) — Outreach & Messaging. Edward Bernays + Alfred Adler. qwen3-vl:8b → haiku.
- **Ada Hypatia** (id: ada) — Content & Resources. Ada Lovelace + Hypatia. qwen3-vl:8b → haiku.

### Model Reconfiguration
- Pulled qwen3-vl:8b (6GB, vision). Primary for Scout, Dewey, Ed, Ada.
- Brunel stays devstral (code model).
- ALL sub-agents capped at Haiku fallback max.
- Tyler strongly prefers local models.

### Tyler's Vision
- Daily trending sounds/videos research for photography socials
- Lead scraper for R3 Studios → $10k/mo goal
- Outreach agent crafts solutions and emails for leads
- Resource creator: bride resources (free) + photographer education (free + paid)
- Marcus: one actionable thing per day, proactive
- Existing assets in reeseai-memory to build on

### Running Tasks (as of 10:49pm)
- Brunel: UI updates (cost display, shift+enter, AnselAI/R3 split)
- Dewey: asset scan of drive for existing content/leads/resources
