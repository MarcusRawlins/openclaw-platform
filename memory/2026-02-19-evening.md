# 2026-02-19 Evening — Tyler's Vision Dump

## Mission Control Chat: WORKING
- Device pairing was the final blocker. Approved Tyler's device, chat connects now.

## UI Fixes Requested
1. Cost display: show today's cost + % change from yesterday in top bar. Click for details: today, week, month vs prior periods, year average.
2. Shift+Enter for line breaks in webchat
3. Split "Financials" into two sections:
   - **AnselAI** — Photography CRM (clients, financials, everything photography)
   - **R3 Studios** — SaaS dev shop (clients, financials, everything SaaS)

## AnselAI
- Tyler's photography CRM brand name. Named after Ansel Adams.
- Houses all photography business: clients, financials, pipeline, content, resources

## Content Tab
- Tyler likes the start, wants it finished
- Needs agent doing daily trending sounds/videos research
- Agent proposes how to incorporate trends into photography business socials
- Existing content ideas in reeseai-memory volume

## New Agent Needs
1. **Trends/Content Agent** — daily research on trending sounds, videos. Creates content ideas for photography socials. 
2. **Lead Scraper Agent** — scrapes web and socials for businesses that need websites/SaaS. Finds leads for R3 Studios.
3. **Solutions/Outreach Agent** — takes leads from scraper, crafts solutions and value propositions, drafts outreach emails. Goal: $10k/mo.
4. **Resource Creator Agent** — goes through photography data, creates resources:
   - Free resources for potential brides
   - Free + paid resources for aspiring wedding photographers
   - Scraping agent should also find ideas for sellable resources (videos, PDFs, courses)

## Marcus's New Standing Task
- Daily: come up with one actionable thing to help Tyler achieve his goals
- Be proactive, think strategically, don't wait to be asked

## Existing Data
- reeseai-memory volume has existing content ideas, lead data, resource ideas from old system
