## Stalled Revision Queue Check (9:03 AM)

4 tasks stuck in needs_revision since Feb 24 (~68 hours). All assigned to Brunel. Zero active sessions working on them.

### Spawned Brunel Revision Sessions:
1. **MC-6: Agent Metrics Dashboard** (f4697434) — Walt: framework-only, no components/API. Brunel re-deployed.
2. **Meta OAuth Integration** (28f77e7a) — Walt: planning docs only, no code. Brunel re-deployed.
3. **MC Messaging Fix** (5d50ce6f) — Walt: WebSocket broken, no implementation. Brunel re-deployed.

### Needs Tyler Decision:
4. **Redeploy Render Demos** (redeploy-render-demos) — Requires Render web dashboard access or API key. Can't be automated without credentials.

### Escalated to Tyler
All 4 tasks exceeded 48-hour threshold. Tyler notified via Telegram with options for the Render task.

### Also in needs_review (not stalled):
- Test Task Phase 2 (cb968aef) — updated today
- AnselAI Phase 1 Foundation — updated today
- MC Content Viewer Popup — updated today

## Major Session (1am - 2:30pm) - Appended

### Infrastructure Fixes
- All cron jobs moved to local LLM (was Opus, causing rate limits)
- Fixed wrong model path `openai/lmstudio` → `lmstudio/qwen/qwen3-4b-2507`
- LM Studio MLX backend fixed: `lms runtime get mlx` re-downloads bundled Python 3.11
- MLX backend backed up to /Volumes/reeseai-memory/backups/lmstudio/
- LM Studio reduced to 2 active models: Devstral 24B (Brunel) + Qwen3 4B (everyone else)
- DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3 VL still installed, just not in active rotation
- Tyler deleted Gemma, wants only MLX models
- Added dummy apiKey to lmstudio provider for subagent auth
- Copied auth-profiles.json to all agent directories

### Agent Config (Final)
- Marcus: Opus | Brunel: Devstral 24B | Scout/Dewey/Ed: Qwen3 4B | Ada: Sonnet (writing), local (vision) | Walt: GPT-4 Turbo
- All agents tested and confirmed working

### Queue Processor System
- 6 cron jobs (one per agent) 2am/2pm daily, staggered 10 min
- Brunel 2:00, Walt 2:10, Scout 2:20, Ada 2:30, Ed 2:40, Dewey 2:50
- Agents work continuously through queue until empty
- 9am stalled task checker also kept as safety net

### Demo Sites
- All 8 on Render (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- basePath/assetPrefix was set for GitHub Pages, broke Render (all CSS/JS 404'd)
- Fixed 4 manually, Brunel building r3-demos monorepo for all 8 (Option B)
- Render API key updated: rnd_dmw3veHHspoAmpRyJczd2RlfYvzp

### Mission Control
- Pushed to GitHub: MarcusRawlins/mission-control (old repo was jwtidwell's)
- Running via pm2 on 0.0.0.0:3100
