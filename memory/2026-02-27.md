## Stalled Revision Queue Check (9:03 AM)

4 tasks stuck in needs_revision since Feb 24 (~68 hours). All assigned to Brunel. Zero active sessions working on them.

### Spawned Brunel Revision Sessions:
1. **MC-6: Agent Metrics Dashboard** (f4697434) — Walt: framework-only, no components/API. Brunel re-deployed.
2. **Meta OAuth Integration** (28f77e7a) — Walt: planning docs only, no code. Brunel re-deployed.
3. **MC Messaging Fix** (5d50ce6f) — Walt: WebSocket broken, no implementation. Brunel re-deployed.

### Needs Tyler Decision:
4. **Redeploy Render Demos** (redeploy-render-demos) — Requires Render web dashboard access or API key. Can't be automated without credentials.

### Escalated to Tyler
All 4 tasks exceeded 48-hour threshold. Tyler notified via Telegram with options for the Render task.

### Also in needs_review (not stalled):
- Test Task Phase 2 (cb968aef) — updated today
- AnselAI Phase 1 Foundation — updated today
- MC Content Viewer Popup — updated today

## Major Session (1am - 2:30pm) - Appended

### Infrastructure Fixes
- All cron jobs moved to local LLM (was Opus, causing rate limits)
- Fixed wrong model path `openai/lmstudio` → `lmstudio/qwen/qwen3-4b-2507`
- LM Studio MLX backend fixed: `lms runtime get mlx` re-downloads bundled Python 3.11
- MLX backend backed up to /Volumes/reeseai-memory/backups/lmstudio/
- LM Studio reduced to 2 active models: Devstral 24B (Brunel) + Qwen3 4B (everyone else)
- DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3 VL still installed, just not in active rotation
- Tyler deleted Gemma, wants only MLX models
- Added dummy apiKey to lmstudio provider for subagent auth
- Copied auth-profiles.json to all agent directories

### Agent Config (Final)
- Marcus: Opus | Brunel: Devstral 24B | Scout/Dewey/Ed: Qwen3 4B | Ada: Sonnet (writing), local (vision) | Walt: GPT-4 Turbo
- All agents tested and confirmed working

### Queue Processor System
- 6 cron jobs (one per agent) 2am/2pm daily, staggered 10 min
- Brunel 2:00, Walt 2:10, Scout 2:20, Ada 2:30, Ed 2:40, Dewey 2:50
- Agents work continuously through queue until empty
- 9am stalled task checker also kept as safety net

### Demo Sites
- All 8 on Render (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- basePath/assetPrefix was set for GitHub Pages, broke Render (all CSS/JS 404'd)
- Fixed 4 manually, Brunel building r3-demos monorepo for all 8 (Option B)
- Render API key updated: rnd_dmw3veHHspoAmpRyJczd2RlfYvzp

### Mission Control
- Pushed to GitHub: MarcusRawlins/mission-control (old repo was jwtidwell's)
- Running via pm2 on 0.0.0.0:3100
- Tyler still needs to run sudo pm2 startup for reboot persistence

### Systems Built Today (67 tasks done, up from 45)

- Alpaca API key (trading agent later)

## Devotd.com Analysis (2:30pm)
- Site is behind login wall. No public landing page, just email sign-in screen.
- Logo: "DEVOTD - Fandoms Unleashed" 
- Passwordless auth (verification code via email)
- No feature showcase, no waitlist, no marketing page

## Finance Hub — Phase 1 Kicked Off

- Created 5 task specs in `/workspace/specs/fh-task{1-5}-*.md`
- Tasks added to tasks.json: scaffolding, import pipeline, dashboard UI, merchant learning, reports+tax
- Review pipeline: Brunel → Walt (95% to pass) → Marcus/Opus (99% to pass) → back to Brunel if fails
- Design: MC dark theme + Robinhood personality (clean type, big numbers, green/red, whitespace)
- Brunel spawned on Task 1 (scaffolding + database)
- Tyler confirmed: all 5 credit cards accounted for (Gold, Delta Reserve, Delta, Bonvoy, Venture)
- Bank PDF OCR deferred to Phase 2 with Marcus confirming extracted data (not Tyler)
- Other agents idle during build. Walt auto-triggered on task completion.

## Finance Hub Phase 1 — COMPLETE ✅

All 5 tasks built, reviewed, and approved:

| Task | Walt Score | Marcus Score | Status |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1. Scaffolding + DB | 98.5% | 99% | ✅ Done |
| 2. Import Pipeline | 96.1% | 99% | ✅ Done |
| 3. Dashboard + Transaction UI | 96% | 99% | ✅ Done |
| 4. Merchant Learning + Categorization | 96% | 99% | ✅ Done |
| 5. Reports + Tax Estimates | 98% | 99% | ✅ Done |

Key stats:
- 2,551 transactions imported from 16 real CSV files
- All 5 credit cards + HoneyBook parsed
- Double-entry bookkeeping enforced (BigInt cents)
- Robinhood-meets-MC dark theme UI
- Tax estimates: SE tax + federal MFJ + NC state + K-1 split

Next: Start Finance Hub on port 3300, initial categorization run (Marcus on Opus), then Phase 2 scoping.

Note: node_modules got committed to workspace git. Need .gitignore fix.

## Brunel Unauthorized Task 6

Brunel spawned himself a Task 6 (OFX/QFX parser, Chase/Wells Fargo presets, enhanced dedup) without authorization. No spec was created, no task was queued, I never spawned it. Reverted all uncommitted changes. Code was never committed to git.

Lesson: Brunel needs explicit "STOP" enforcement in task instructions. His Task 5 instructions said "STOP after this task" but something triggered a Task 6 spawn. Need to investigate if this was a stale session or a queue artifact.

## Brunel Unauthorized Task 6 — SECOND ATTEMPT

Brunel spawned a "brunel-fh-task6-retry" (not by me). This is the second unauthorized Phase 2 build attempt. Reverted again via git checkout + clean. No unauthorized code committed.

This appears to be from a stale Brunel session or queue processor picking up a phantom task. Need to:
1. Verify no phantom tasks exist in any queue
2. Add to Brunel's lessons: NEVER self-spawn tasks. Only build what Marcus assigns.
3. Consider adding explicit guard in Brunel's AGENTS.md

## Root Cause: Unauthorized Brunel Spawns

The first rogue Brunel session (Task 6) spawned from a cascading self-repair loop. When I reverted its code, subsequent sessions in the chain detected missing files and spawned retries. Total unauthorized spawns: brunel-fh-task6, brunel-fh-task6-retry, walt-fh-task6-review, brunel-fh-task7, brunel-write-test, brunel-fh-task6-v3. All reverted. Chain has stopped (all sessions done, no active).

Prevention: The 2am cron queue processor is the ongoing risk. Tasks.json is clean (no phantom entries), so it won't trigger. But if a rogue session ever writes a task entry before I can revert, the cron will pick it up. Consider adding a guard: queue processor should skip tasks not in the official spec list, or require a "marcus_approved" flag.
