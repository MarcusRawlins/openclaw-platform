# 2026-02-27 Daily Notes

## Major Session (1am - 12:30pm)

### Rate Limit Crisis → Resolved
- All 14 cron jobs were on Opus, exhausting Anthropic rate limits and blocking Tyler's conversations
- Switched all cron jobs to local LLM (lmstudio)
- Initially used wrong model path `openai/lmstudio` (broken for 6 hours) → fixed to `lmstudio/qwen/qwen3-4b-2507`

### LM Studio MLX Backend Fix
- MLX backend's bundled Python 3.11 was deleted from `~/.lmstudio/extensions/backends/vendor/_amphibian/`
- Fix: `lms runtime get mlx` re-downloads full backend (257MB) with signed Python
- DO NOT symlink brew Python (code signature mismatch, different Team IDs)
- Backed up to `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/backups/lmstudio/` (1.2GB)
- Fix documented at `docs/reference/lm-studio-mlx-fix.md`
- Tyler deleted Gemma (GGUF), wants only MLX models on Apple Silicon

### Current LM Studio Models (all MLX)
- Devstral Small 2 24B (Brunel)
- DeepSeek R1 Qwen3 8B (Scout, Dewey, Ed)
- Qwen3 4B (heartbeats, cron jobs)
- Qwen3 VL 8B (vision)

### Agent Model Assignments
- Marcus: Opus | Brunel: Devstral 24B | Scout/Dewey/Ed: DeepSeek R1 | Ada: Sonnet (writing), local (vision) | Walt: GPT-4 Turbo
- All agents tested and confirmed working

### Queue Processor System Built
- 6 cron jobs (one per agent) at 2am/2pm daily, staggered 10 min apart
- Brunel 2:00, Walt 2:10, Scout 2:20, Ada 2:30, Ed 2:40, Dewey 2:50
- Agents work continuously through their queue until empty
- needs_revision tasks get top priority

### Auth Fix for Subagent Spawns
- Added dummy apiKey `lm-studio-local` to lmstudio provider config
- Copied auth-profiles.json to all agent directories

### Tasks Completed Today
- 67 total tasks done (up from 45)
- Marcus cleared 9 tasks from his queue (memory restructure, telegram notifications, browser control, playwright skill, trading agent architecture, skill gap analysis, archive memory, walt project map, agent metrics spec)
- Brunel built: Financial Dashboard backend, Agent Performance Metrics v2, Knowledge Base Vector Search (946 chunks indexed), AnselAI Phase 2 Frontend, MC Client Portal, Meta OAuth implementation, MC Messaging E2E testing
- Walt reviewed 11 tasks total, 83% pass rate

### Demo Sites
- All 8 deployed on Render (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- apex-plumbing had static HTML not source code → changed Render to serve static files
- Render API key: updated in .env (rnd_dmw3veHHspoAmpRyJczd2RlfYvzp)

### Mission Control
- Pushed to GitHub: MarcusRawlins/mission-control (old repo was jwtidwell's)
- Running via pm2 on 0.0.0.0:3100 (accessible on LAN)
- Tyler still needs to run sudo pm2 startup command for reboot persistence

### Credentials Received
- Meta/Threads: Access token, App ID (1913743373352501), App Secret saved to .env
- Render: New API key saved to .env

### Email Pipeline
- Himalaya working with marcus-work and marcus-personal accounts
- Tyler will forward bythereeses and getrehive emails to accessible accounts
- No extra passwords needed

### Ada Caption Work
- 4 iterations on day-after formals caption for Park City photos
- Tyler wants: first person (Tyler/Alex), educational structure, 1800-2195 chars, Utah tradition framing
- Logged lessons in Ada's lessons.md
- Ada uses Sonnet for writing, local for vision/analysis (baked into config)

### Still Needed From Tyler
- sudo pm2 startup command (MC reboot persistence)
- Brave Search API key (better lead research)
- Alpaca API key (when trading agent starts)
