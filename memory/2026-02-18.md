# 2026-02-18 - Day One

## Bootstrap Complete

Tyler Reese introduced himself. Wedding photographer, SaaS co-founder, systems thinker, LDS faith. Gave a comprehensive brief covering personal, relational, spiritual, business, creative, and identity-level goals.

Key business targets:
- Photography: $250k in 2026, $500k in 2027
- SaaS: $10k/mo by end of April, $25k/mo by end of 2026

Cost philosophy established: Opus is for Marcus only. All other agents on lesser/local models. Optimize for token efficiency. Local-first when possible.

Set up USER.md, IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md already existed with full persona spec.

## Details Filled In
- Timezone: Eastern (Greensboro, NC)
- Photography brand: Alex & Tyler (The Reeses) - bythereeses.com
- Channels: Webchat + Telegram
- Spirit animal chosen: Lobster 🦞

## Infrastructure Set Up
- Telegram connected and working
- GitHub CLI installed, authenticated as MarcusRawlins
- Ollama: qwen3:4b (heartbeats) + devstral (Brunel's code model)
- Heartbeats: local Ollama qwen3:4b, every 2h, 7am-11pm ET (zero API cost)
- Brunel Edison: first team member, builder agent. Haiku primary, Devstral fallback. No messaging/gateway/cron access. Reports to Marcus only.
- Cloned jwtidwell/mission_control as reference for our dashboard
- Decided: build on OpenClaw (not separate ReeseAI system), adapt Mission Control for our needs
- Backups: /Volumes/reeseai-memory primary, /Volumes/BACKUP nightly (not Google Drive)

## Still Need
- SaaS product name and current status
- Set up git repo for our workspace

## 2026-02-19 Mission Control Planning

- Tyler confirmed: build FROM Jeff's codebase, don't rewrite
- Brunel audited: ~8,500 lines, 48 files, Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind 4
- Tyler wants to KEEP: Blueprint view, agent expressions, templates, whiteboard, cron management
- Only stripping: demo data
- Read "Product Requirements & Feature Inventory.rtf" on Desktop — massive PRD from another OpenClaw user (Matt's setup). CRM, financials, social analytics, 22 skills, council systems, cron jobs
- PRD aligns well with Mission Control direction: single pane of glass for agents, clients, finances, operations
