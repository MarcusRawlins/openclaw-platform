# 2026-02-26 — Daily Notes

## Massive Spec + Deployment Session (9:00 AM - 10:00 AM, Opus)
- Tyler requested 4 additional systems overnight: Memory System, Notification Queue, Cron Automation, Financial Tracking
- Elevated to Opus for spec writing
- Wrote all 4 specs on Opus:
  1. `/workspace/specs/notification-priority-queue.md` (16KB) — 3-tier queue, classifier, digest formatter
  2. `/workspace/specs/cron-automation-system.md` (15KB) — Log DB, wrapper script, failure detection
  3. `/workspace/specs/file-based-memory-system.md` (18KB) — Team-wide memory, weekly synthesis, lean boot
  4. `/workspace/specs/financial-tracking-system.md` (19KB) — CSV import, NL queries, confidentiality
- Total specs written (2 sessions): 10 specs, ~200KB

## Queue Reprioritized
- AnselAI Phase 1 moved to BOTTOM (low priority)
- New order: Notification Queue → Cron → Memory → Financial → RAG → Content Pipeline → Briefing → BI Council → AnselAI

## Team Deployed (Parallel Work)
- Brunel: Spawned on devstral, starting Notification Priority Queue, 4-hour session, will auto-advance through queue
- Dewey: Spawned on gemma-3-12b, creating directory scaffolding for all systems
- Future: Scout can help with RAG file preparation

## Key Decisions
- Both morning briefing AND nightly council, BOTH between 12a-8a
- Results-focused (action items required, not just analysis)
- Opus for BI Council synthesis
- CRM sync = Mission Control + AnselAI + R3 Studios data
- Agents stay lean on startup (AGENTS.md ~50 lines + lessons.md ~20 lines)
- Heartbeat stays local (LM Studio, zero API cost)
- All modules must work together as integrated system

## Brunel Status
- Content viewer popup: COMPLETED last night (11:42 PM, files exist)
- Now starting notification priority queue
- Full queue: 9 tasks, estimated ~22-28 AI days

## Other Agents Can Help
- Dewey: Directory scaffolding, testing, data organization
- Scout: RAG file scanning, KB preparation
- Ada: Documentation, user guides
- Parallelization cuts total time significantly
