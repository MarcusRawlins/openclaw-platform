# 2026-02-21 — SEO Image Workflow + Agent Automation + System Control

## Summary
Completed SEO image renaming project (776 images across 5 weddings). Built hourly agent task automation. Created reusable SEO workflow skill. Fixed Blueprint UI bugs. Set up Tailscale VPN with firewall access control. Built comprehensive system control skills and decision tree.

## SEO Image Project Complete ✅

**Scout's keyword research** (11:49 PM Feb 20):
- 5 featured weddings: Cairnwood, Dayton Arcade, Biltmore, Wychmere Beach Club, Charleston
- Primary + secondary keywords per venue
- Strategic picks: venue-specific, low competition, high intent
- Saved to: `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/photography/content/seo/wedding-keywords-2026-02-20.md`

**Ada's CSV generation** (12:55 AM):
- 776 images processed
- Format: old_filename, new_filename, alt_text
- Alt text: 80-125 chars, keywords naturally integrated
- Saved to: `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/photography/content/seo/image-seo-2026-02-21.csv`

**Dewey's file renaming** (7:01 AM):
- All 776 images renamed in place
- Originals backed up to: `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/photography/assets/wedding-images-backup/2026-02-21/`
- New pattern: `venue-name-wedding-##.jpg`
- 100% success, zero data loss

**Timeline:** Scout (3 min) → Ada (4 min) → Dewey (1.5 min) → Walt review (~2 min) = ~10-12 minutes total

**Lesson learned:** Direct spawns bypass the task queue. Need task chaining so completing one auto-activates the next.

## SEO Image Batch Skill Created

**Location:** `/Users/marcusrawlins/.openclaw/workspace/skills/seo-image-batch/SKILL.md`

**Purpose:** Reusable workflow for SEO-optimizing wedding image batches

**Invocation:** "Process SEO images for [folder/venue]"

**Workflow:** Scout (keywords) → Ada (CSV) → Dewey (rename) → Walt (review)

**Target time:** 10-15 minutes end-to-end

## Agent Hourly Task Automation ✅

Built hourly cron jobs for all agents to check and work on their tasks:
- **Walt** - :00 - Reviews NEEDS_REVIEW queue
- **Ada** - :15 - Picks up active tasks or NEEDS_REVISION items
- **Brunel** - :20 - Picks up active tasks or NEEDS_REVISION items
- **Scout** - :25 - Picks up active tasks or NEEDS_REVISION items
- **Ed** - :30 - Picks up active tasks or NEEDS_REVISION items
- **Dewey** - :35 - Picks up active tasks or NEEDS_REVISION items

**Flow:**
1. Agent completes work → marks task `needs_review`
2. Walt reviews at top of hour → grades PASS/NEEDS_REVISION
3. If NEEDS_REVISION, agent picks it up next hour and fixes it
4. Loop continues until PASS

**Result:** Full automation. Agents self-correct without manual intervention.

## Mission Control Updates

**Brunel completed (Walt reviewed, both PASS):**
1. Blueprint UI fixes (activity box, agent labels, z-index, spacing)
2. Blueprint break room (idle agents move to casual area with furniture)

**UI improvements:**
- Activity panel slides in from off-screen (no overlap)
- Agent labels minimal (name + status dot, details on hover)
- Popups render on top (z-9999)
- Offices spaced out (300px horizontal gaps)
- Break room with coffee table, couch, water cooler, plant
- Smooth 1s transitions

## Tailscale VPN Setup ✅

**Status:** Live and accessible from anywhere

**Mission Control URL:** http://marcuss-mac-mini.taild34a1b.ts.net:3100

**Connected devices:**
- Marcus's Mac mini (100.99.154.65)
- iPhone (100.97.254.31)
- Tyler's MacBook Air (100.109.85.24)
- Brady's Mac mini (100.115.204.111) - BLOCKED from port 3100

**Firewall access control:**
- Configured macOS pf (packet filter)
- Brady's device blocked from accessing Mission Control port 3100
- Rules persist across reboots
- Config: `/etc/pf.anchors/com.mission-control`

**Installation process:**
- Marcus installed Tailscale via Homebrew
- Completed GUI installer programmatically
- Authenticated with jtyler.reese@gmail.com
- Configured firewall directly (didn't need Tailscale ACL API)

## System Control Skills Created ✅

### 1. System Control Skill
**Location:** `/workspace/skills/system-control/SKILL.md`

**Purpose:** Complete guide for Mac automation

**Covers:**
- When to use Peekaboo (GUI automation)
- When to use browser tool (web tasks)
- When to use exec (terminal/CLI)
- When to use Read/Write/Edit (files)
- Common patterns and workflows
- Permission requirements
- Lessons learned (anti-patterns)

### 2. Automation Decision Tree
**Location:** `/workspace/docs/AUTOMATION-DECISION-TREE.md`

**Purpose:** Quick reference for tool selection

**Includes:**
- Quick decision matrix (task → tool mapping)
- Action flowcharts for common scenarios
- Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- Pre-task checklist
- Critical prerequisites

**Key lesson:** Should have used Peekaboo for Tailscale installer instead of asking Tyler to click through it manually.

## Tools Installed

1. **Chrome** - for browser control testing (previously Safari-only)
2. **Tailscale** - VPN for remote Mission Control access
3. **Peekaboo** - already installed, permissions still needed

## Peekaboo Permissions Needed

**Required (one-time setup):**
- Screen Recording permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security)
- Accessibility permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security)

**Without these:** Peekaboo can't capture screenshots or control UI

**Test command:** `peekaboo permissions`

## Brunel's Current Queue (MC Priority)
1. AnselAI + R3 Studios nav sections (high priority)
2. Git init (Mission Control + AnselAI repos)
3. MC-6 Metrics Dashboard
4. Backup automation
5. Google/Meta OAuth integrations
Then: AnselAI Module 1C resumes

## Key Decisions
- SEO workflow saved as reusable skill (not one-off task template)
- Keyword research stays in the flow (verify + update each time)
- Full chain under 15 minutes is acceptable
- Hourly agent checks prevent timeouts/abandoned tasks
- Tailscale firewall configured via macOS pf (didn't need Tailscale ACL API)
- System control documented comprehensively with decision trees
- Marcus should handle all GUI tasks independently using Peekaboo

## Open Items
- Task chaining system (completing task A auto-activates task B)
- Google/Meta API credentials from Tyler (OAuth integrations blocked)
- Grant Peekaboo permissions (Screen Recording + Accessibility)
- Test browser control with Chrome extension relay
- My own memory restructure (cap MEMORY.md at 120 lines)
