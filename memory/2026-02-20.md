# 2026-02-20 — Mission Control Build Sprint

## Summary
Built a complete task management system for Mission Control. Paused AnselAI development. Restructured content organization by business. Started API integration planning for The Reeses.

## Major Accomplishments

### Mission Control Task System (MC-1 through MC-5)
- **MC-1:** Task data model + API routes (CRUD, filtering, Walt's review endpoint)
- **MC-2:** Task board UI (4-column Kanban: QUEUED → ACTIVE → NEEDS REVIEW → DONE)
- **MC-3:** Blueprint integration (agents show current active task, status badges, detail popups)
- **MC-4:** Walt's trigger button (green "Get to Work" button on Blueprint and task board)
- **MC-5:** Expression sync (agents' faces update based on task state: focused=working, happy=submitted, questioning=reviews pending, celebrating=completed, relaxed=idle)

### Infrastructure
- Disabled fake "brainstorming mode" (was pulling agents into conference room every 4 hours)
- Fixed Blueprint UI: activity panel now slides in from left, agent labels stripped to name+dot, hover popups render on top
- Set up hourly Walt cron (checks needs_review queue automatically, writes trigger file for manual runs)
- Created 6 infrastructure tasks: directory map, git init, backup automation, notifications, metrics, memory restructure

### Content Organization Restructured
- **The Reeses** (photography): `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/photography/content/`
- **R3 Studios** (SaaS): `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/r3-studios/content/`
- Each has: blog/drafts/, social/, resources/
- Ada's crons updated to save to photography paths
- MC nav will have AnselAI and R3 Studios as separate business sections (not a content toggle)

### Learning System Implemented
- Each agent has `/agents/[id]/lessons.md` (max 20 lessons, oldest archived)
- Walt appends lessons on every non-PASS review
- Agents read lessons on boot, learn from accumulated feedback
- Archives live at `/Volumes/reeseai-memory/agents/[id]/lesson-archive/` (never deleted, just archived)
- Walt gets calibrated by Marcus via `/agents/walt/lessons.md`

### Task System Live
- 14 real tasks seeded (AnselAI 1C, lead research, outreach, content, metrics, etc.)
- Walt's first hourly run: caught a missing deliverable (test task), sent it back to Ada
- Brunel's active task (Blueprint fixes) shows on his agent card in Blueprint
- All tasks persist across refreshes, status changes trigger expression updates

## API Integration Started
- Google Cloud Console: need Client ID, Secret, Analytics Property ID (Gmail, Calendar, Analytics, Business Profile APIs)
- Meta Business Suite: need App ID, App Secret, long-lived access token (Instagram Graph, Marketing, Facebook Login)
- All free tier, no costs
- Tyler to provide credentials; will build data pipelines + dashboards in MC

## Brunel's Current Queue (MC Priority)
1. Blueprint break room (idle agents move there)
2. AnselAI + R3 Studios as nav sections
3. MC-6: Metrics dashboard
4. Git init (Mission Control + AnselAI)
5. Backup automation
Then: AnselAI Module 1C resumes

## Key Decisions
- Mission Control is top priority over AnselAI build
- Content organized by business, not a single tab
- Agents learn from reviews via lessons.md (max 20 active, older archived)
- Storage: workspace (small/active), memory drive (heavy/archival)
- Agent boot context: ~70 lines (AGENTS.md + lessons.md only)

## Open Items
- Google/Meta API credentials from Tyler
- Dewey hasn't created shared directory map yet (queued task)
- My own memory restructure (cap MEMORY.md at 120 lines, archive to drive)
- Walt's hourly cron had an announce delivery error (needs diagnosis)
