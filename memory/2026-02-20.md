# 2026-02-20 - Morning

## Overnight Config Changes
- Heartbeats changed to every 1 hour (was 2h), still qwen3:4b local, 7am-11pm ET
- Tyler confirmed: agents should store nothing in memory/heartbeats, everything external and queried on demand

## Pending from Last Night
- Brunel was building: cost display, shift+enter chat fix, AnselAI/R3 Studios nav split — STATUS UNKNOWN, need to check
- Dewey was scanning drive for existing assets (content ideas, leads, resources) — STATUS UNKNOWN, need to check
- First daily actionable for Tyler is due this morning
- Ed Adler and Ada Hypatia are registered but never deployed yet
- Need headshot images for Ed and Ada (Tyler generates these)
- Mission Control chat: WORKING after device pairing fix

## 8:30am — Redeployed Failed Tasks
- Brunel and Dewey tasks from last night timed out during gateway restart. My fault.
- Lesson: after any gateway restart, verify running sub-agents. Redeploy if killed.

## Dewey Asset Scan Complete
- Report at /Volumes/reeseai-memory/data/EXISTING-ASSETS-REPORT.md
- Content: 24+ skill modules, Marketing Lab course, 5 blog posts, content calendar
- Leads: 43 fresh JSON lead files (plumbers, HVAC, landscaping, real estate, NC/VA/SC). Ready for outreach.
- Photography: bridal guide, 2026 investment guide, posing guides, checklists, 4 contracts, 5+ transcribed courses
- R3 Studios GAP: no pitch decks, case studies, or pricing docs. Need to create these.
- Outreach email generator already exists from old system

## Brunel UI Updates Complete
- Cost display in TopBar ($X.XX today + % change, click for detailed breakdown)
- Shift+Enter for line breaks in chat
- Nav restructured: Operations, Blueprint, AnselAI, R3 Studios, Clients, Content, System, Documents
- AnselAI sub-tabs: Overview, Pipeline, Financials
- R3 Studios sub-tabs: Overview, Clients, Financials
- Server restarted on port 3100

## Daily Actionable (sent to Tyler)
- 43 lead files ready for outreach. Proposed: Scout qualifies top 10, Ed drafts personalized emails. Fastest path to $10k/mo.

## Tyler Directives (8:30am)
- Old agents are DEAD. Extract useful content, give to our agents, delete the rest. No old names/processes.
- Everything vetted against our stack. Keep what fits, trash what doesn't.
- Clients tab removed from Mission Control. Clients live inside AnselAI and R3 Studios.
- Nav finalized: Operations → Blueprint → AnselAI → R3 Studios → Content → System → Documents

## Brunel: Nav Fix Complete
- Removed Clients standalone nav item
- CRM accessible as sub-tab inside AnselAI
- R3 Studios already had its own Clients sub-tab

## Dewey: Asset Restructure Complete
- Deleted entire /agents/ directory (132 files, all old personas)
- Old skills were mostly empty frameworks (30-50 lines, no real content)
- Created /Volumes/reeseai-memory/resources/ with clean consolidated files:
  - sales/sales-frameworks.md
  - content/content-frameworks.md
  - outreach/outreach-frameworks.md
  - photography/photography-resources-index.md
  - courses/courses-index.md
- Gaps: no email copy from PDFs, no R3 pitch deck, no tested content bank, outdated vendor lists
- Reports: RESTRUCTURE-REPORT.md, CLEANUP-LOG.md
